// Lets TypeScript type a `.vue` import (e.g. `import Foo from './Foo.vue'`)
// without a dedicated Vue plugin loaded. Defense in depth — the Vue/Volar
// tooling ordinarily resolves `.vue` files on its own, but tools that don't
// (a plain `tsc`, some editor setups) need this ambient declaration.
declare module '*.vue' {
  import type { DefineComponent } from 'vue'

  // Matches Vue's own `create-vue` scaffold shim.
  // eslint-disable-next-line ts/no-empty-object-type -- `{}` here means "no declared props/emits", not "any object"
  const component: DefineComponent<{}, {}, any>
  export default component
